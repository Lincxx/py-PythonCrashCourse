# 3-2. Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just
# printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message
# should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the
# person’s name.

names = ['Jeremy', 'rhonda', 'James', 'Shelly']
message = ", I truly enjoy our friendship."

print(names[0] + message)
print(names[1] + message)
